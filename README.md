# CARduino
The code and design for James Libbey's freshman Embedded Systems project, created in collaboration with Matt Hawkins.

Using an Arduino, construct the circuit shown in circuitDiagram.pdf, following the standard pin connections for the LCD screen. Then, download the code in CARduino1-0.ino onto the Arduino to play.

Use the dial to adjust the car's speed, going faster to gain more points based on the feedback on the LCD screen. Once the light turns yellow, turn the dial so that the car stops moving before the red light appears. After running three red lights, the game is over and the high score is recorded.
